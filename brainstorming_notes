Jumping from a function call site to function definition site.
(Browsing through code should be really easy. Step into/out of functions?)
Same with types, should be real easy to see definitions of things.
I quess this requires editor/IDE to have an *understanding* of the whole project.

Support for multiple languages?
Extendability. Why not just write a codebase that is easy to understand and build, then extend by adding C/C++ source code... No scripting languages, no shared libraries. ? Have extendability in mind.

Modes. Try out Vim-style modes.
