Jumping from a function call site to function definition site.
(Browsing through code should be really easy. Step into/out of functions?)
Same with types, should be real easy to see definitions of things.
I quess this requires editor/IDE to have an *understanding* of the whole project.

Support for multiple languages?
Extendability. Why not just write a codebase that is easy to understand and build, then extend by adding C/C++ source code... No scripting languages, no shared libraries. ? Have extendability in mind.

Modes. Try out Vim-style modes.

* small codebase
* code easy to understand (learning resource for beginners?)
* easy and fast to build
* cross platform (Linux, Windows, ...?)
* extendability? like DWM? no scripting languages! simple and straightforward.
* fast (on older machines)
* efficient (no wasting of computer resources)

small, easy, fast, efficient

TODO:
- See if Treesitter and/or language servers can do something for us.

IMMEDIATE MODE UI?

{
	// event/render loop

	make_textBoxSingleLine(MyBuffer, MyCursor, MyScrollState);
	make_listBox(MyFilelist.Items, MyFilelist.CurrentlySelectedItem, MyFilelist.ScrollState);
	// event?
}
